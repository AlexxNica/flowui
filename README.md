# Cloud Threads UI 


This is a demoware visualisation tool for showing what's going on with cloud threads in real time. 


## running: 

You need nodejs (tested with 7.8.0)

this assumes that the completer is running on 127.0.0.1:8081 and the corresponding functions server is running on 8081

```bash
 npm install 
 npm run-script run 
```

the UI should be available on [http://localhost:1979]


## Notes
 
 The UI should start visualising the first cloud thread function that starts  automatically , and will list any cloud threads functions that have started since the UI was opened.
